## Build it for Android

First, just follow the [Flutter install instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and install Flutter as well as the Android SDK. If you've done so, clone the repository, connect your Android device and simply:

    cd fcalc
    flutter pub get
    flutter run --release

## What about IOS?

I can't confirm that this works as I simply don't own any Apple devices, but if you've set-up Flutter correctly for IOS development the above commands should also work for you. 

## Modify it

You are highly encouraged to fork the project and adapt the calculator to your liking or add functions and constants that you are currently missing. The project is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE), which should allow you to do pretty much everything with it.
